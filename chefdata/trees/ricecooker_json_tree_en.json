          "description": "The biggest focus of any Aflatoun teacher-training workshop is naturally on practice teaching. Perhaps you remember these sessions? Teachers are given lesson plans from the Aflatoun books and asked to present a mock lesson. The other participants then critique their performance using a set list of questions. One ofthe aims of those micro-teaching  sessions is to help teachers use a variety of teaching methods, beyond simply lecturing. In this module we look more closely at one aspect of classroom teaching i.e. the ratio of Teacher Talking Time versus Student Talking Time as this is very often a reliable way of measuring  the  extent  to  which students are  actively engaged  in  their  own learning. We hope that you enjoy this module, that it helps refresh your memory, provides you with a fuller  understanding of this  aspect of active-learning  and maybe  even inspires you with some  new ideas.",

Brainstorming is a very simple method on the face of it, and yet many of us teachers can find it a little bit challenging at first because it requires us to do many things that we might not be used to e.g. letting children talk in an unregulated way, not correcting their answers initially etc. We hope that you enjoy this module, that it helps refresh your memory, provides you with a fuller understanding of this aspect of active-learning and maybe even inspires you with some new ideas.",
